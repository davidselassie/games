# Dare Rules

We often play games that involve dares. To keep them fun, there are few rules
we've come up with to keep dares fun and safe (but not too safe).

- If the dare costs money, the darer has to pay.

- No "life altering" dares.

- If the they refuse, even if it's a valid dare, they're banned from daring
  other people.
