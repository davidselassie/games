Encyclopedia of group games!

## Contributing

We'd love to have you add, clarify, expand, and jazz up our list of group games!

### Adding a New Game

Want to add a new game? Each of the game descriptions lives in the `_games`
folder. You can add a new file in there by clicking
[here](https://github.com/selassid/games/new/gh-pages/_games). Name it something
like `hotpotato.md`, or a short version of the new game's name with `.md` at the
end (you need that!). Then copy in [the game description
template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selassid/games/gh-pages/_drafts/template.md)
and fill it with the info for your new game. See the **Game Descriptions**
section below for what you should write!

To see if your formatting looks good before you're done, click the **Preview**
tab at the top. Once you're done, click the **Commit** button at the bottom to
save your description.

### Editing an Existing Game

Want to clean up or add to an existing game? Go to the game's page, and click
the edit description link at the bottom.

Similar to adding a game, use the **Preview** button to see if your formatting
looks good and the **Commit** button at the bottom to save your changes.

## Description Content

Write up some good instructions for how to play the game. This can be any text
that you want! Remember, someone who has never even seen the game before has to
be able to understand them! You can markup your text using
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax); see
[the game description
template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selassid/games/gh-pages/_drafts/template.md)
for an example of how to do that.

One tricky thing is that a blank line is required for a new paragraph:

```markdown
Without a blank line
the text is combined.
```

```markdown
With a blank line

you get a new paragraph.

With a blank line

you get a new paragraph.

### Header

In addition to the instructions for how to play the game, there's also some
metadata in a header at the top. It is the stuff between the `---`s at the top
of the file. It is in a very particular format so the computer can read it and
allow people to find your game on the site. You should fill out as much of the
information as possible!

- `title` should be the name of your game

- `alttitles` should be a list of alternate names people know your game by; this
  can be left out if there aren't any

- `tags` should be a list of labels that classify your game; you have to type
  them out _exactly_ like those in the section below

- `oneliner` should be a short catchy description of the game; maybe people who
  don't know the name remember what it's like

- `players` is a more specific range of how many players this game is good for

- `tools` is a list of physical tools you need to play the game; this can be
  left out if there aren't any

Anything that's a "list" above should be in the [YAML list
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Lists) like

```yaml
tools:
  - Hammer
  - Nail
```
