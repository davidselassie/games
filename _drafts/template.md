Everything after the second `---` is just text! You can write whatever you want
here!

You can add headers using `# Header Name`, lists by prefixing with `-`s, and
bold text by surrounding in `*stars*`. Check out
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax), for
all the things you can do! If you're editing from the GitHub webpage directly,
try using the `Preview Changes` link to see if your description looks good.

One tricky thing is that a blank line is required for a new paragraph. Two
adjacent lines will be run together. You also need a blank line before lists.

Here's a sample game description:

# Setup

Describe how to setup the field or any preparations you'll need to make!

# Gameplay

How do you play the game? What happens during each round?

# Winners

How do you win the game? Do you hog-tie everyone else?

# Variations

Describe some cool variations:

- Maybe play with your eyes closed.
- Maybe play the game with one trapped in a sleeping bag.
