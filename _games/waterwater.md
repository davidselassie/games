# Setup

Everyone stands in a circle. One person starts with a full water bottle.

# Gameplay

People take turns being the **pourer**. When the pourer first gets the water
bottle, everyone sings the **chorus** together to the tune of the first verse of
[Alouette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X36_5JYt8yY):

> Water, water
>
> We love water, water
>
> Water, water
>
> It's so good to me

Once everyone has sung that, the pourer turns to a **victim** and **requests**
to pour water on a specific location or via a specific method onto the victim:

> Would you like it _____________ ?

To which the victim _must_ reply:

> I would love it _____________!

To which everyone _must_ express their astonishment by repeating the request.

To which the victim _must_ reiterate that, yes, they are getting water poured in
that requested way.

Everyone then sings the chorus while the pourer then acts out their request upon
the victim.

The victim then becomes the new pourer and repeat until no more water.

## Example

> _Everyone_: Water, water / We love water, water / Water, water / It's so good
> to me
>
> _Jane (looking at Bob)_: Would you like it in your ear?
>
> _Bob_: I would love it in my ear!
>
> _Everyone_: In your ear?!?!
>
> _Bob_: In my ear.
>
> _Everyone (while Jane is pouring water in Bob's ear)_: Water, water / We love
> water, water / Water, water / It's so good to me
>
> _Bob (looking at Mary)_: Would you like it in your shoes?
>
> _Mary_: I would love it in my shoes!
>
> _Everyone_: In your shoes?!?!
>
> _Mary_: In my shoes.
>
> _Everyone (while Bob is pouring water in Jane's shoes)_: Water, water / We
> love water, water / Water, water / It's so good to me
