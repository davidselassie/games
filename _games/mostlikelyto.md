# Gameplay
People take turns asking questions like "who is most likely to _something_?". E.g:
* Who is most likely to lose their wallet tonight?
* Who is most likely to meet someone they know on the street?
* Who is most likely to be a Russian spy?

When you know who you think in the group is the answer to that question, you raise your hand. Once everyone is ready, count to three, and on three everyone points at who they think answers the question.

Whoever is pointed to by the most other people has to drink.

If you think _you_ are the answer for most other people, you can cross your arms instead of pointing and then whoever points at you has to drink. If nobody points at you, you have to drink.
