Each round, everyone is working together on a group drawing. One artist does not
know the topic of the drawing, but is trying to fake that they know it. All of
the other artists want to keep the topic a secret from them.

# Setup

The round starts by picking a **commissioner**; everyone else is an **artist**.
Each artist needs one small scrap of paper, like a notecard or sticky note.

The commissioner picks a **secret topic** of the drawing. They don't tell
anyone, but write the secret topic on each of the artists' scraps of paper
_except for one_. On one of the scraps, they write "fake".

The scraps with the secret topic and "fake" are randomly shuffled and passed out
to all of the artists. Whichever artist gets "fake" is now the **fake artist**
for the round.

Artists should keep their topic scraps hidden! They don't want the fake artist
to see the topic.

# Gameplay

Now it's drawing time! Get out a blank piece of **paper** and a **pencil or
pen**. All artists (including the fake) now take turns drawing _a single line_
on the paper. A single line can be curvy or straight or cross itself and start
anywhere, it just can't involve picking up and putting down the pencil.

Once each artist has drawn one line, go around the circle again. Each artist
will finish two lines in total.

_The goal is not to finish the drawing!_ It's just to prove to everyone that you
know the topic.

# Voting

Once each artist has drawn two lines, a minute or two of silent analysis is
allowed. Feel free to ask and discuss who drew what line, but _no other
discussion can happen_. The point of the game is to communicate through the
drawing.

At the end of the discussion, every artist is going to vote for who was the
fake. The commissioner will hold the vote by counting to three and each person
points at who they think the fake artist is.

If a real artist gets the most votes, the fake artist wins! If the fake artist
gets the most votes, they can defend themselves; if they can say the secret
topic by this point, then they still win! If the fake artist gets the most
votes, but doesn't know the secret topic, everyone else wins.

# Variations

- Give each person a different colored pencil to make it easy to see what they
  drew.

- Instead of writing "fake" on one slip, write a different topic; have everyone
  guess who had the different topic and the topic the other side had.

- Play a version without drawing: instead take turns asking someone a question
  about the shared topic and listen to their answer.
