# Gameplay

Players take turns telling the plot of a famous movie, but as if it was a story
that personally happened to them. They can change the characters and location to
match parts of their real life, but the main plot points should stay the same.

Everyone else listens to the story, then raises their hand when they know what
movie the story is. Once everyone knows, the storyteller's turn is up and
someone else goes.
