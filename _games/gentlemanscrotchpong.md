# Gameplay

Everyone sits in a circle on the ground with their legs splayed and a beer
placed a few inches in front of their crotch. People take turns tossing the ping
pong balls at other people's beers. If your beer gets hit, you take a sip.
You're allowed get up to retrieve a ping pong ball from outside the circle, but
if your can is hit while you're up, you have to finish your beer.

Everybody wins.

# Variations

- If your beer is done, you're out. Play until one person remains.
