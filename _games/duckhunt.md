## Gameplay
About half the group are picked to be "ducks." The other half are "hunters." Hunters each get a frisbee. Everyone lines up on one sideline of a field, alternating hunter and duck.

When someone yells "go," the ducks are released and the hunters count to 5. Ducks have to get away from the hunters as fast as possible, but:

- They can't run, they can power walk, though
- They are not allowed to look back or turn around
- They must keep moving forward at a constant speed
- They are allowed to shuffle side-to-side while moving forward
- They have to quack

Once the hunters count to 5, they are allowed to throw their frisbee in an attempt to hit a duck. All the ducks that get hit are out and become hunters in the next round. Keep playing rounds until there is only one duck left.
