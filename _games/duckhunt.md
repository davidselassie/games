# Setup

About half the group are picked to be **ducks**. The other half are **hunters**.
Hunters each get a frisbee. Everyone lines up on one sideline of a field,
alternating hunter and duck.

# Gameplay

When someone yells "go," the ducks are released and the hunters count to 5.
Ducks have to get away from the hunters as fast as possible, but:

- They can't run, they can power walk, though
- They are not allowed to look back or turn around
- They must keep moving forward at a constant speed
- They are allowed to shuffle side-to-side while moving forward
- They have to quack

Once the hunters count to 5, they are allowed to throw their frisbee in an
attempt to hit a duck. All the ducks that get hit are out and become hunters in
the next round.

# Winners

Keep playing rounds until there is only one duck left.
