# Gameplay

Players sit in a circle. Each player is given a medium sized scrap of paper.

The goal of each player is to be the first to write all the numbers from 1 to 50
on their paper.

One random player starts with the pen. If you have the pen, you can write.

Other players take turns in a circle rolling the die once each. If they roll a
one or a six, they can grab the pen and start writing. The player currently with
the pen doesn't roll the die on their turn.

There's no requirement that each person who rolls a one or a six has to be able
to write; if another one or six is quickly rolled, the next roller can steal the
pen right away.

# Variations

Numbers can be checked for legibility when someone claims to have won. If the
other players can't read the number, the win doesn't count.
