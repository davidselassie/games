# Gameplay

People take turns being the **accuser**. The accuser points at someone and
**accuses** them of something (e.g. "David has peed the bed in the last year!").
Everyone else who thinks it's true raises their hand. The accused then reveals
if it's true. Those who guessed whether it was true incorrectly drink.
