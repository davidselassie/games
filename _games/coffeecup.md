# Gameplay

One player is picked to be in the **hotseat**. It picks a **verb** or a verb
phase. Other players ask questions replacing the verb with Coffee Cup and the
hotseat player responds with yes, no, or elaborates if the answer is not
completely yes or no.

For example, main player picks the verb "running".

> Player 2: "Do you need legs to coffee cup?"
>
> Hotseat Player: "Yes you need legs to coffee cup."
>
> Player 3:"Can you coffee cup in water?"
>
> Hotseat Player: "Generally, no you do not coffee cup in water."
>
> Player 4: "Do you need to be in shape to coffee cup?"
>
> Hotseat Player: "Yes, you need to be in shape to coffee cup for for large
> amounts of time."

This process continues until the players figure out the verb.
