# Setup

One person is picked to be **It**. Everyone else is the **crowd**. They leave
the room and the crowd comes up with three **tasks** for It to complete.

Tasks should be physical actions and have specific and deliberate steps:

- Walk to the fridge, open it, take the milk out, carry that to the cups, pick
  up the one red cup, pour a glass of milk.

- Walk to the light switch of the room, flick it on and off repeatedly.

- Take off your shirt.

Once three specific tasks and an order for them to be completed are agreed upon,
It is invited back into the room with wild applause.

# Gameplay

When It returns to the room, the crowd becomes silent. The only way the crowd
communicates what tasks It should perform is by cheering them on. The crowd
should give varying levels of reinforcement to It to guide them:

- Clap politely if they face or look at where they need to go.
- Clap vigorously if they start reaching towards any objects they need.
- Cheer wildly when they start performing the right action.

The crowd immediately becomes totally silent if It starts to stray from the
steps of the task. Expect lots of sudden cheering mixed with complete silence as
It figures out the task.

It's job is made easier if they are very deliberate about exploring. They should
probe out different directions and wait for feedback, and pretend to touch
objects to see if the crowd reacts.

Once It has completed a task, everyone holds up the number of fingers of tasks
remaining. They then are guided to the next task in order.
