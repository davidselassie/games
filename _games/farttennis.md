# Gameplay

Whoever farts first says "service!" and "serves" the ball and they are now the
**hitter**. Whenever someone else farts they say "return" the ball is "returned"
and they become the new **hitter**. If you fart when you're the hitter, say
"score" and you get a point.

# Variations

## Doubles

Work in teams of two. If either person in a team farts, the whole team becomes
the **hitting team**. The whole team can score by farting while being the
hitting team.
