# Setup

Give out a **drawing paper** and pen to each person. On the back of your drawing
paper, write your name.

# Gameplay

Everyone closes their eyes, then someone says go, and counts to ten seconds.
During those ten seconds, everyone draws a self portrait while their eyes are
closed. At the end of time, everyone stops and puts their drawings in a pile in
the middle of the table _face up_ (so the names still can't be seen). Then
everyone opens their eyes.

# Scoring

Once everyone has opened their eyes, display all the portraits face-up on the
table. On their fronts, someone label them A, B, C, etc.

Then each person takes their **score card** and tries to match A, B, C, etc.
with each person playing.

Once everyone's had a chance to write out all their guesses, flip over the
drawing papers to see what the correct answers are. Score yourself.

Whoever guesses the most self portraits correctly wins!

# Variations

If you don't have identical pens or pencils to give to each person, before
drawing, put all the pens in the middle, and while people have their eyes
closed, reach for a pen, count to ten and draw, then put all the pens and papers
back in the middle, thus no one will have seen someone holding a specific pen.

Instead of self portraits, draw:

- Your first pet
- Your house
- Your parents
- Your bike
- Your favorite shirt
