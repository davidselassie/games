# Gameplay

Circle up. Someone will start with the **wah**. They pass the wah by clapping
their hands above their heads and slicing their hands down yelling "WAH,"
pointing at someone else in the circle. If you were pointed at, you receive the
wah by yelling "WAH" and clapping your hands and slicing them up above your
head. Once your hands are above your head, the people on either side of the
circle have to slice your stomach with a similar hand motion. The wah continues
to be passed until someone makes a mistake.
