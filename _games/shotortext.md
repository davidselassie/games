# Gameplay

Everyone puts their cell phone in a hat. Pass the hat around and each person
pick out a random cell phone; they can't pick their own. Everyone then spends
three minutes choosing a contact in the cell phone they've picked and _only
drafting_ a message of their choosing.

Then, go around the room and each person says whose phone they have, the
possible recipient, and the drafted message. The owner of the phone then gets to
decide whether they will take a shot or press send on the drafted message.

Be _really careful_ that you don't accidentally send the message before the
owner decides if it should be sent. It's no fun when the surprise is ruined.
