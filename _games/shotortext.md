## Gameplay
Everyone puts their cell phone in a hat. Pass the hat around and each person pick out a random cell phone; they can't pick their own. Everyone then spends three minutes choosing a contact in the cell phone they've picked and _only drafting_ a message of their choosing.

Then, go around the room and each person says whose phone they have, the possible recipient, and the drafted message. The owner of the phone then gets to decide wheither they will take a shot or press send on the drafted message.

Be _really careful_ that you don't accidentally send the message before the owner decides if it should be sent. It's no fun when the surprise is ruined.
