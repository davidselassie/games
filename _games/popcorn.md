# Gameplay

The goal of this game is for everyone to work together to say the alphabet from
A to Z. No one playing is allowed to communicate in any other way other than
saying the next letter. If any two people speak at the same time, everyone has
to start over!

How do you know when to speak? Feel the vibes!

# Variations

Instead of enumerating the alphabet, try other things:

- Count to some number.
- Say the words to a song everyone knows.
