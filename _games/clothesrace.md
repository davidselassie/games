oneliner: Make a bridge out of clothes
players: 15+
tools:
  - Field with two sidelines
---
# Gameplay

Form two teams. Each team has to pick one **walker**. Everyone starts behind one
sideline. The goal for your team is to get your walker to the other sideline
first, but they are not allowed to touch the bare field. You have to build a
**bridge** for them using your team's clothes. The bridge has to remain
unbroken, so clothes can't be removed once they're part of the bridge. First
walker to make it to the other sideline wins.

# Variations

- If someone is willing to be naked, their body is allowed to be part of the
  bridge.
