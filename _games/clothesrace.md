oneliner: Make a bridge out of clothes
players: 15+
tools:
  - Field with two sidelines
---
# Gameplay
Form two teams. Each team has to pick one "walker." Everyone starts behind one sideline. The goal for your team is to get your walker to the other sideline first, but they are not allowed to touch the bare field. You have to build a bridge for them using your team's clothes. The bridge has to remain unbroken, so clothes can't be removed once they're part of the bridge. First walker to make it to the other sideline wins.

# Variations
* If someone is willing to be naked, their body is allowed to be part of the bridge.
