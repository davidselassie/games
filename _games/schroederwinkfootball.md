oneliner: Pass the energy football
players: 2 - ~30

# Setup

Everyone stands in a circle.

# Gameplay

This is a pass the energy game. One person starts with the energy.

There are three ways to pass the energy:

- Football - Lets you pass the energy to anyone in the circle, but the person
  who just sent it to you. Say "football" and look at someone.

- Schroeder - Lets you pass the energy only to the person who just sent it to
   you. Say "Schroeder" and look at that person.

- Wink - Is a fake out Schroeder. It lets you pass the energy only to the person
  who just sent it to you. Say "wink" and look at _any other person_ than the
  person who just sent it to you. Fake out!

Each move has a way you can mess up:

- If you football back to the person who just sent it to you.
- If you Schroeder to someone other than the person who just sent it to you.
- If you wink and look at the person who just sent it to you.

If you mess up, either by breaking the above rules or by doing none of the above
actions, you drink.

# Variations

You could also play this as a non-drinking game and have the circle shrink when
someone messes up. Play until one person is standing.
