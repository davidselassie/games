# Gameplay

Every round begins with each person having a blob of whipped cream sprayed in
their upturned palm. Save it, for you will have to throw it. Good throwing
technique is to jerk your hand up, then snapping the blob off by hitting the
throwing arm’s wrist down with your other hand.

# Rounds

- Toss a blob into your own mouth
- In teams of two, simultaneously toss blobs to each others’ mouths
- In teams of three, do the same
- High five someone else

Everybody wins!
