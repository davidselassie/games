oneliner: Catch a stick only by the handle
players: 2 - ~8
tools:
  - A stick about a foot and a half long
  - Colored tape or some way of marking part of the stick
---
# Setup

Prepare a **sword**: Take the stick and wrap about 4 inches on one end in tape.
This taped end is the **handle**.

# Gameplay

People take turns tossing the sword to a person. If they catch the stick one
handed with at least one finger touching the handle, they're **safe**. If they
don't catch the sword touching the tape or drop it, then they **lose a limb**!
They also can **pass** and and be safe if they don't try to catch the sword at
all. Hide lost limbs behind your back; you can't use them! All tosses and
catches are _one handed_.

The first limb lost is the arm used to catch the sword, the second is one of
your legs, the third is the other leg.

# Winners

Once you've missed three times, you'll have lost all of your limbs and you're
out. Keep playing until one person is standing.
