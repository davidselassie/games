# Setup

Draw out a large box, 16 feet by 16 feet large. Divide the box into four
sections, each 8 feet by 8 feet. Make a queue outside the box. The first four
people get on the corners of the box and the fifth person stands in the middle.

# Swaps

The goal of the four corner people is to get the middle person "out." This is
done by "swapping" on them three times. A swap is when any two of the corner
people swap positions without the middle person tagging an abandoned corner.
More than two people are allowed to swap, e.g. a "cycle right" is allowed.

# Flow

Once the middle person has witnessed three swaps without taking a corner,
they're out, they go to the back of the line and a new challenger is in the
middle. If the person in the middle successfully makes it to an abandoned
corner, they stay and become a new corner person, then whichever corner person
is left without a corner is out, goes to the back of the line, and a new
challenger is in the middle.
