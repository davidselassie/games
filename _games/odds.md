# Gameplay

At any point, you can think of a dare for someone else to do. Go up to them and
ask them "what are the odds that you'll _whatever dare_?" E.g:

- What are the odds you'll take a shot of catsup?
- What are the odds that you'll take 10 selfies with strangers tonight?
- What are the odds you'll wear your shoes next time you shower?

# Dare Rules

The dare rules are the same as in the Die Game.

- If the dare costs money, the darer has to pay.

- No "life altering" dares.

- If the they refuse, even if it's a valid dare, they're banned from daring
  other people.

They then present some odds like "1 in X". E.g. "1 in 10" or "1 in 5" or "1 in
100". The odds they pick will be the probability that they have to do this
thing. So if they don't want to do it, they can pick smaller odds.

Now we have to see what happens! On the count of three, both of you say a number
between 1 and X inclusive. If both of you say the same number, that's a hit!
They have to do the dare.

# Special Odds

There are two "special" odds that might cause _you_ to do the dare. They are a
check to make sure your dares aren't too crazy:

- If they say "1 in 1", you _both_ have to do the dare.

- If they say "1 in 2" and it hits, they still have to do it, but if it misses,
  _you_ have to do it.
