oneliner: Bounce ping pong balls into growing cup towers
players: 2 - ~30
tools:
  - Large table
  - ~20 stackable cups
  - Two ping pong balls
---
# Setup

Clear off a large table. Place two empty cups on opposite each other near the
edge of the table; these are the starting **stacks** of a single cup.
**Cluster** all of the remaining cups in the middle of the table; fill one of
them all the way up with beer and place it in the center of the cluster, fill
the remaining cluster cups with an inch of beer.

Everyone circles around the table. The two people directly in front of the
stacks get ping pong balls.

# Gameplay

It is your turn when you get a stack passed to you. On your turn, your job is to
bounce the ping pong ball on the table and then into the top cup of the stack;
repeat until you succeed. As soon as the ping pong ball is in, pass the stack
and ball clockwise to the next person without a stack in the circle.

If you would pass your stack to someone who already has one, tap the top of
their stack with yours, skipping them.

If you get skipped, you have to grab another cup of beer from the cluster, drink
it, add that new cup to the top of your stack, then continue attempting to
bounce the ball into the top of the stack to finish your turn.

The center beers will slowly become incorporated into the two stacks that are
circling the table. As they grow taller, it becomes harder to bounce the balls
in.

# Winners

Whoever gets lapped when there is one cup remaining has to drink the full beer
and buy the beer for the next round.
