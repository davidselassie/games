# Gameplay

This game is played at any time with friends who know the rules.

At any point and from any recognizable distance, if you make eye contact with
someone who is playing and mime blowing through your hands as if a blowgun, you
have **darted** them.

They must lay down wherever they are unable to move, but still can talk, until
_anyone_ walks up to them and pulls the invisible "dart" out of their neck.
They're free to verbally convince passers-by to do this, or the shooter can walk
to them and do that.

# Variations

## Fishing Line

The shooter is also allowed to "fishing line" the dart out of their victim's
neck from any distance by making a casting a fishing rod and reeling something
in motion. This is just so the dart-er does not have to walk over to the dart-ed
to help them.
