## Gameplay
Players write 1-10 funishments on small sheets of paper. Funishments are a silly dare, part punshiment and part fun. The slips of paper with funishments are then folded up and put into a hat or jar. Other players then pull the slips of paper and perform the funishment.

### Example Funishments
- Hug a stranger walking down the street
- Pantomine your favorite musical until everyone guesses its name
- Trade pants with the person sitting next to you

## Variations
- Players combine funishments with an existing games and the loser must do a funishment. Such as players play Catch Phrase and the loser pulls a slip of paper.
- As a rule of thumb to prevent mean funishments, if the person who draws the funishment feels too uncomfortable to complete the funishment, the writer must then complete the funishment.
