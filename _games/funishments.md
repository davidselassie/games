# Gameplay

Players write 1-10 funishments on small sheets of paper. Funishments are a silly
dare, part punishment and part fun. The slips of paper with funishments are then
folded up and put into a hat or jar. Other players then pull the slips of paper
and perform the funishment.

## Example Funishments

- Hug a stranger walking down the street
- Pantomime your favorite musical until everyone guesses its name
- Trade pants with the person sitting next to you

# Variations

- Players combine funishments with an existing games and the loser must do a
  funishment. Such as players play Catch Phrase and the loser pulls a slip of
  paper.

- As a rule of thumb to prevent mean funishments, if the person who draws the
  funishment feels too uncomfortable to complete the funishment, the writer must
  then complete the funishment.
