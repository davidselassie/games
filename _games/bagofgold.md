# Setup

One person at is selected to start as the **troll**. They are protecting the
**bag of gold**. Everyone else is a **human** and they are working together to
steal the bag of gold.

# Gameplay

If you are the troll, your goal is to protect the bag of gold. If you tag anyone
else, they are out and removed from the round. If anyone else touches or grabs
the bag of gold, they become the new troll; all humans have to back up ten feet
when that happens, then they can resume playing.

# Winners

When there is only one person remaining, they are the winner.
