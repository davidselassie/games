# Setup
One person at is selected to start as the troll.
They are protecting the bag of gold.
Everyone else is a human and they are working together to steal the bag of gold.

# Gameplay
If you are the troll, your goal is to protect the bag of gold.
If you tag anyone else, they are out and removed from the round.
If anyone else touches or grabs the bag of gold, they become the new troll; all humans have to back up ten feet when that happens, then they can resume playing.

# Winners
When there is only one person remaining, they are the winner.
