# Gameplay

Each round begins with someone new on the **hotseat**. Everyone else then
collectively comes up with two dichotomies that are "dimensions." Examples would
be East Coast vs West Coast, Mountains vs Ocean, PB vs Jelly, Guns vs Butter.
Once youâ€™ve picked two, draw some 2D axes and label each with the dimensions.
Each person then takes turns putting a dot with their initials in the space
where they think the person on the hotseat "is:" either what they like or what
their personality is like. Once everyone else has gone, the person on the
hotseat puts a star where they actually are. Closest person wins that round. The
hotseat rotates, and you come up with new dimensions.
