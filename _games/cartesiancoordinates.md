## Gameplay
Each round begins with someone new on the hotseat. Everyone else then collectively comes up with two dichotomies that are "dimensions." Examples would be East Coast vs West Coast, Mountains vs Ocean, PB vs Jelly, Guns vs Butter. Once you’ve picked two, draw some 2D axes and label each with the dimensions. Each person then takes turns putting a dot with their initials in the space where they think the person on the hotseat "is:" either what they like or what their personality is like. Once everyone else has gone, the person on the hotseat puts a star where they actually are. Closest person wins that round. The hotseat rotates, and you come up with new dimensions.
