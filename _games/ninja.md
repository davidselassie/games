# Start

Circle up with each person putting both hands in the middle. The game begins
with everyone jumping back and assuming a ninja pose!

# Attack Order

Someone is selected to attack first. Only one person attacks at a time and the
attack moves around the circle. The order of attack is fixed from the start
clockwise around the circle. _Even if you move around later, you still attack in
the starting order._ Everyone must be frozen unless they are attacking or
currently being attacked. The next attacker is allowed to strike as soon as the
previous one has completed their ninja move, so it can rotate very quickly! The
person who is attacking circles around until only one person remains.

# Attacking

The goal is to hit other people’s hands with ninja chops. If you are hit in the
hand by someone else’s hand, you’re out; step out of the circle. An attack must
be a single swift ninja move: a single arc of an arm or jump; no "out and back."
When you are attacking, you are allowed to move by jumping.

# Defending

If you are being attacked, you are allowed to defend by moving your hands out of
the way once the attacker has started their movement; you are not allowed to
move your feet. If you move your feet or fall over, you’re out. If you move or
flinch before the attacker has actually attacked, you must return to your
original frozen position.

# Variations

- Each hand is its own "life" and if one gets hit, you just hold it behind your
  back until your other hand is hit.

- If you attack out of turn or flinch when you’re not being attacked, you are
  punished right then by having to assume the "bunny position:" wrists are held
  to chest and your elbows are at your side. When attacked, you can only defend
  by moving your whole torso+hands out of the way. If your wrists leave your
  chest, you’re out. When it’s your turn to attack next, your only move can be
  to "unbunny" which is assume a normal ninja pose without attacking someone.
