# Gameplay

This is a way to decide a "winner" out of a large group of people. Everyone
spreads out, and once the game begins starts challenging people to
rock-paper-scissors. Establish the rules (on shoot vs on three, best of three vs
best of one) before you set people free! If you lose, you introduce yourself to
the victor and then you follow them around cheering them on as their posse. If
they lose, you join the victorâ€™s posse. At the end there will be one final
one-on-one with two giant posses cheering on the contestants.
