# Gameplay
The first round is *pancakes* vs *waffles*. Take a vote to see which one more people like better. "Better" means whatever you want it to mean. The thing that loses the vote is now banished from existence! Someone starts the next round by picking a thing that they personally think is _only slightly better_ than the winning thing from the last round. Vote again and banish the new loser from existence.

Play until you can't play no more.
