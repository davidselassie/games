# Gameplay

The first round is _pancakes_ vs _waffles_. Take a vote to see which one more
people like better. "Better" means whatever you want it to mean. The thing that
loses the vote is now banished from existence! Someone starts the next round by
picking a thing that they personally think is _only slightly better_ than the
winning thing from the last round. Vote again and banish the new loser from
existence.

Play until you can't play no more.
