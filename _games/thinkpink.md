oneliner: Quick rhyming guessing word game
players: 2 - ~10+
---
# Gameplay

The purpose of the game is to guess the phrase.  One person in the group thinks
of a rhyming phrase made up of two words and is "It".  If the words have one
syllable each, the "it" says "I have a think pink."  If the words have two
syllables each, the "it" says "I have a Thinky Pinky."  If the words have three
syllables each, the "it" says "I have a Thinkedy Pinkedy." The It player also
has to give a clue.  The others have to guess what the rhyming phrase is.

# Example

The It player says, I have a Thinky Pinky and the clue is Ben and Jerry's.  Then
everyone knows that we're looking for a rhyming phrase of two syllables each
word. People guess different examples of two word phrases with two syllables
each, including Joey Schmoey (maybe thinking about two guys names) and Very
Berry (ice cream flavors). Finally, the right answer is suggested: Chunky
Monkey.
