# Setup

Split into two teams. Pick one person from each team to form the "council." A
different person from each team to be the "artist."

The councilmembers go off an decide a picture subject in secret. They don't tell
anyone else.

The artists prepare two equally sized drawing areas in the sand or dirt a few
feet across. You could make this look like a table tennis court; the two drawing
areas are back-to-back.

The rest of the crowd is going to act as guessers. They should split up by team
and stand behind their artist.

# Gameplay

At the same time, the councilmembers whisper the subject into the ears of the
artists. The artists then have to draw as fast as they can the subject, while
the rest of the crowd yells out guesses for what the subject is.

Once the artist hears someone on their team shout the subject, they raise their
hands and have won!

# Variations

- Make a sand sculpture instead of a drawing.

- Whoever is running the game can set up the drawing areas and bury a drink deep
  in the sand and smooth it over. Then once the artist hears the correct answer
  yelled out, they must start digging, find the drink, then finish it first to
  win.
