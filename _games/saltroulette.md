# Setup

Rip open all of the sugar packets. Pour out all the sugar from just one and fill
that one with salt.

Shuffle all the packets so no one can easily tell which is the salt one.

# Gameplay

Everyone stands in a circle. Pass out all the packets. Go around the circle and
one-by-one take the shot of the packet.

Your goal is to hide the fact you got a salt packet!

Once everyone is done, on the count of three, everyone points at who they think
got the salt packet. You win if you got it right. You lose or drink if you got
it wrong.

# Drinking Versions

- Conservative Version: Instead of salt, use a shot of vodka; instead of sugar
  use a shot of water. Guess who got the vodka.

- Liberal Version: Instead of salt, use a shot of water; instead of sugar use a
  shot of vodka. Guess who got the _water_.
