oneliner: Sneak a rock between people
players: ~5
tools:
  - Some small item or rock
---
# Setup

Find an item to be the **rock** which should be small enough to be put in
someone's pocket. Pick someone to be the **detective** for the first round.
Everyone else are the **thieves**.

# Gameplay

The goal of the thieves is to pass the rock between them five times without the
detective noticing. The detective gets five attempts at guessing who has the
rock; if they guess successfully, the detective wins the round. Whenever the
thieves pass the rock between them, the giving thief has to inform the receiving
thief what pass number this is, and the giving thief, as soon as the transaction
is complete, needs to tell the detective what pass number they just finished.

# Winners

If the detective guesses that someone has the rock and they do, the detective
wins. If the thieves pass the rock five times successfully, the thieves win.

At the end of the round, someone new is the detective.
