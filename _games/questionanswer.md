# Gameplay

With the other person, first decide on a question / answer form and who will be
thinking of which part. See the examples below.

Now spend some time coming up with your question or response independently.

Now on the count of three, the question asker asks their question, then the
answerer says their answer. See if it makes sense!

# Forms

- _Why_ is the moon round? _Because_ my dog ate it.
- _When_ should I go to bed? _When_ the cows come home.
- _What is_ my weakness? _It is_ new reality TV show.
- _How_ do you run a business? _By_ the hair of my chinny chin chin.
