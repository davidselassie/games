# Gameplay

If you have a die, you can go up to someone and dare them to do something.
First, pick a dare, then pick a number on the die. _Confidence is key_: phrase
your dare as "when I roll this _number_, ..."

- When I roll this 4, you have to go up to a person of my choosing and ask them
  to pose for a cocktail napkin portrait and draw them.

- When I roll this 1, you have to walk backwards until we leave the building.

- When I roll this 2, you have to change your Facebook picture to one of my
  choosing for the rest of the week.

Once you have your dare, roll the die. If it shows the number you said, it's a
hit! They have to do the dare. If not, they don't have to do anything. In either
case, the die is passed on to them and they can dare someone else.

If you roll the die and it does not land perfectly flat on a surface, (e.g. in
the crack of a wooden table, in the grass, on someone's shoe) that is a foul,
and _you_ have to do the dare. So don't pick dares you'd never consider doing.
Even if you foul, the original target gets the die.

# Dare Rules

- If the dare costs money, the darer has to pay.

- No "life altering" dares.

- If the they refuse, even if it's a valid dare, they're banned from daring
  other people.
