# Make the Game

Take the sheets of paper and rip them up into 3" square pieces, about enough for
each person to have 5. Give everyone a pen and about an equal number of the
pieces of paper.

Now spend 30 minutes where each person fills out the blank cards they were
given.

## Filling Cards

Each card has to have a few things to be an official **Thousand Blank Cards**
card:

1. Title - Name the card something fun

2. Illustration - Some illustration (perhaps) related to the card

3. Dare / Rule / Act - Make up a dare or a new rule or an act that has to be
   performed to get the points on the card; go wild, as this can involve
   multiple players, the cards in play, other's points, really anything; imagine
   every game you've ever played and use that as inspiration

4. Point Value - The card should have some instructions for how to give (or
   remove) points for doing the act (or for other cases)

## Example Cards

- Bit by a Cat: You must meow after every sentence. -10 points

- Fire Marshal: Pick a card in someone else's hand. Burn it with a lighter. +1
  point

- Communist Grocery: Add everyone's points together. Divide them evenly. +1000
  points for doing the hard work

- Who Let the Dogs Out?: You get to play also after any cat-related card is
  played. +500 points

This game is _very_ free form. There are no bad cards, but it can be fun and
clever when cards interact with each other.

# Play the Game

Once all the cards have been filled out, deal out all the cards evenly. Gameplay
is going around a circle taking turns giving a card from your hand to another
player. They should read the card _by themselves_ first, then if no instruction
precludes reading the card, read it aloud, then perform the action to get the
number of points.

Once all the cards have been played, the player with the most points "wins", but
really everyone wins.
