# Gameplay

Circle up around an empty open paper **bag**. Players take turns attempting to
pick up the bag with their mouth, only touching the ground with their feet. Once
everyone has successfully picked up the bag, tear ~1" off around the top, making
the bag shorter, and repeat. If you touch the ground with a not-foot while
picking up the bag, you’re out. When one person is left, they’re the winner.

# Variations

- Only one foot can touch the ground while the bag is being picked up on the ground.
