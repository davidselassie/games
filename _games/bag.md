# Gameplay
Circle up around an empty open paper bag. Players take turns attempting to pick up the bag with their mouth, only touching the ground with their feet. Once everyone has successfully picked up the bag, tear ~1" off around the top, making the bag shorter, and repeat. If you touch the ground with a not-foot while picking up the bag, you’re out. When one person is left, they’re the winner.

# Variations
* Only one foot can touch the ground while the bag is being picked up on the ground.
