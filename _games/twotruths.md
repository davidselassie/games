# Gameplay

Each person takes turns stating three **facts** about themselves.
Two are true facts from their life.
One is a lie.

Everyone else then guesses which is the lie.

# Winners

The game can be played with each person keeping score as to how many of other
people's lies they've guessed. The winner has the most points after some number
of rounds.

# Variations

There are some variations where each person states three different things about
themselves.

- Two goals and a regret
- Two truths and a secret
- A truth, a secret, and a lap dance
