The purpose of this game is to get two players to same the same word at the same time.

Circle up and two adjacent people are selected to "duel." The person to their right counts to three. On "three," the duelers simultaneously say two random words. Those are the starter words. Now the duel shifts one person to the left: the right hand dueler is now the counter and the person to the left of the other dueler is now involved. From this point out, on the count of three, the duelers should say something that they think is "in between" the last two words in the duel. The duel keeps rotating quickly until the two duelers say the same word; then everybody wins!

For example
Player 1: 1, 2, 3
Player 2: Horse and  Player 3:Mean
Player 3 and 4 now need to think of a word that is related to horse and mean.
Player 2: 1, 2, 3
Player 3: Donkey and Player 4: Ass
Player 4, and 1 now need to think of a word that is related to Donkey and Ass
Player 3: 1, 2, 3
Player 4: Mule and Player 1: Mule.

When both players pick the same word, mind has been melded.

### Variations
* If one of the duelers stutters and doesn’t say anything, their word is literally "silence."

For example
Player 1: 1, 2, 3
Player 2: Horse and Player 3: No word 
Player 3 and 4 now need to think of a word that is related to Horse and Silence
