# Gameplay

The purpose of this game is to get two players to same the same word at the same
time.

Circle up and two adjacent people are selected to "duel." The person to their
right counts to three. On "three," the duelers simultaneously say two random
words. Those are the starter words. Now the duel shifts one person to the left:
the right hand dueler is now the counter and the person to the left of the other
dueler is now involved. From this point out, on the count of three, the duelers
should say something that they think is "in between" the last two words in the
duel. The duel keeps rotating quickly until the two duelers say the same word;
then everybody wins!

When both players pick the same word, mind has been melded!

## Basic Example

> Player 1: 1, 2, 3
>
> Player 2: Horse and Player 3: Mean
>
> Player 3 and 4 now need to think of a word that is related to horse and mean.
>
> Player 2: 1, 2, 3
>
> Player 3: Donkey and Player 4: Ass
>
> Player 4, and 1 now need to think of a word that is related to Donkey and Ass
>
> Player 3: 1, 2, 3
>
> Player 4: Mule and Player 1: Mule.

# Variations

## Silence

If one of the duelers stutters and doesnâ€™t say anything, their word is literally
"silence."

### Silence Example

> Player 1: 1, 2, 3
>
> Player 2: Horse and Player 3 said nothing
>
> Player 3 and 4 now need to think of a word that is related to Horse and Silence
