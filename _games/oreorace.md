# Gameplay

Everyone is handed an Oreo. Each person should twist the Oreo apart. Everyone
should then straight up and place the cream half cream-side-down in the middle
of their forehead. The game leader should then say go, and it’s a race to see
who can eat the Oreo half that is on their forehead first. No one is allowed to
use their hands or any tools; the Oreo can only be coaxed towards the mouth by
tilting your head down or using face muscles. If your Oreo drops, you’re out.
