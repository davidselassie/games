# Prelude

Setup monitor / projector so that everyone can see it. Get drunk.

# Make Topics

Cut up the paper into small slips. Everyone writes a few topics on separate
slips and puts them in the bowl. They can be absolutely anything: "lady gaga",
"1943", "yams".

# Present

Someone is picked to present. They search the internet for "TOPIC ppt" and
choose the first PowerPoint presentation that is returned. Download it and then
immediately give the presentation in 2 minutes. Remove the topic from the bowl
once the presentation is done.
