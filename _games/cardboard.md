# Setup

Lay out the **cardboard** on a flat surface. Each person draws a **shape** about
the size of their hand with their name written in it.

# Gameplay

People take turns flipping a quarter onto the cardboard. If the quarter comes to
rest touching a shape with someone's name in it, they have to drink. If it comes
to rest touching no shape, the thrower gets to draw a shape that encloses the
quarter about the size of their hand and write a new **rule** in it. The rule
can be anything. On subsequent tosses if the quarter comes to rest touching that
rule shape, the rule has to be followed.

## Example Rules

- Drink whenever someone else does
- You have to draw new shapes with the pen in your mouth
- If the quarter falls off the sheet, everyone drinks.
