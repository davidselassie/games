## Set Up an Ordering
Get everyone who's playing into some order (e.g. by birthday). The ordering is a cycle; the first person is just after the last person. Start with it being the first person's turn.

## Serve Rules
To start, the 8-ball is placed on one end of the table's spots. The person who's turn it currently is has to hit the 8-ball with the cue ball by rolling it. The 8-ball has to bounce off a wall for the serve to be valid.

## Turn
Your goal on your turn is to run around, grab the cue ball, and roll it at the 8-ball so you hit it. Your turn starts as soon as the person before you in order hits the 8-ball with the cue ball. Your turn ends as soon as you hit the 8-ball with the cue ball.

Your "get a letter" if:

* The 8-ball stops moving on your turn
* The 8-ball goes into a pocket on your turn

If the _cue ball_ goes in a pocket or off the table, your turn is still going!

## Throwing Rules
You can only throw the cue ball:

* With your hips behind the short ends of the table.
* From the opposite half of the table that the 8-ball is currently on.

## Scoring
If you get a letter, take a drink. Once you spell HORSE, you're out and the order closes in around you.

## Variations
* Buzzer beaters: if the 8-ball stops moving, but the cue ball still is moving, a hit counts.
* Bank shots: you are allowed to throw the cue ball from the same half of the table as the 8-ball, but only if you bounce it off the far wall first.
