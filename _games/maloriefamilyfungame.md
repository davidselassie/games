# Make Cards

Cut up paper into small slips. Each person should get ~5 slips. They should
write a short phrase on each. Topics can be anything!

# Circle Up

Split into two equal teams. Sit in a circle with the two teams interleaved.

# Gameplay

Each person has 45 seconds to get the rest of their team to guess as many slips
as they can, using the rules of the current round. The person before them plays
timer. If a slip is guessed, remove it from the bowl. Pass the remaining
un-guessed slips to the next person when your turn is up.

Once the bowl is empty of slips, the round is over. Each team counts up the
number of slips they got and gets that many points. Put all the slips back in
the bowl and continue around the circle using the harder rules of the next
round.

Even when your team isn't guessing, listen! The same cards are in the bowl each
round, so you have to remember what was seen before.

# Rounds

- Taboo: you can say any words but those exactly on the cards

- Charades: no speaking, noises, or pointing at things

- One word: same rules as taboo, but once you say one word, that's the only word
  you can say

# Variations

- Extra round that's "charades under a sheet"
- Charades done under a sheet during round 2 are worth double points
- Extra round that's "one action"
