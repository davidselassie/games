# Gameplay

Everyone is handed at least one fork. Circle up. Someone lobs an apple underhand
to anyone with a fork. The fork holder should try to spear the falling apple
with their fork. If they do, they leave the fork in the apple and lob the
apple+fork up to someone else, who will attempt to spear and add their fork.
Repeat until the apple falls apart or your run out of forks. Careful with your
hands!
