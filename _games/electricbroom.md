# Gameplay

Setup by laying a **broom** across a **stand** or stool so that it's in the
middle and balanced.

Everyone holds hands in a circle around the broom. People all try to drag each
other into the 'electric' broom without letting go their hands. If anyone
touches the broom, they are **out**. Players can jump over broom, move away from
broom, twist and turn, but cannot let go of hands.  If two people let go of each
others' hands, both people are out.

Whenever someone is out, they're removed from the circle and the people next to
them hold hands. Game continues until there is only one player left, who is the
winner! Other players act as referees for the game.
